# TV-remote-GUI
This project was created for usability testing of permissible level of user GUI variability.

1. Give a task to use this GUI to user.
2. After 20-40 clicks the ON/OFF button will increase a little bit. 
Stop the user, and ask if he saw some changes. 
If not, he should continue using the TV remote before reaching next ON/OFF button increase. 
If he saw the ON/OFF button increase and he can confidently describe this change, 
save the iterator of changes to statistics.
